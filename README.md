**Submission Instructions**
---------------------------

1.  **Create a GitHub repository** and push your code.
    
2.  Ensure that your repository includes:
    
    *   src/ (PHP code and frontend files)
        
    *   database/ (SQL export file)
        
    *   README.md with setup details
        
3.  Submit the repository link.

    *   Once you have pushed your progress, Add info-soft2tech as collaborators to the repository. Email with link to your repository. send an email to 
    info@softtronixsolution.in .
    

**Notes**
---------

*   Follow clean coding principles and maintain readability.
    
*   Make incremental commits to showcase progress.
    
*   If stuck, document the challenges faced and your approach to solving them.
